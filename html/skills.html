            <h2 id="skillPython">Python</h2><br>
			<p>
            I first used Python for data analysis during my undergraduate physics labs.
			One of these was a purely computational lab on 
			 <a class="accent-link" href="https://github.com/Gary-Carroll/Electrostatic-Randomisation" target="_blank">Electrostatic-Randomisation</a>. 
			 During 4th year of this degree I completed all of the photometric analysis for my final year project using Python. The files and code can be found 
			<a class="accent-link" href="https://github.com/Gary-Carroll/Cepheid-Variable-Star-Photometry" target="_blank">here</a>.
		The image shown to the right was created as part of my final year project. It shows the changing position of the Cepheid Variable star Y Aurigae on a 
	<a class="accent-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="_blank">Hertzsprung-Russel diagram</a> over its pulsation period.</p>
			<p>I greatly improved my Python skills during my MSc in computer science, completing modules such as Python Programming, Python OOP, and 
				Machine Learning with Python. I created a text-based fighting
				<a class="accent-link" href="https://github.com/Gary-Carroll/Python-Game" target="_blank">game</a> as part of the OOP module.</p>
				<p>As part of my Master's project I created a web scraper to scrape 6 years of historical weather data and wrote a 
					route generating algorithm in Python that formed the basis for our 6 person project.</p>
					<p>Using Python I analysed my last 3000 Lichess chess <a class="accent-link" href="chess.html">games</a>.</p>
					<p>As part of my work in the NTMA, I set up Python for the data services team
						and wrote the documentaion detailing its set-up and use. I implemented Python scripts into our ETL pipeline via TabPy in Tableau Prep flows.
						I have used Python to train machine learning models, implement sensitive name masking into the ETL pipeline,
						perform sentiment analysis on free-text fields, and perform similarity analysis on free-text fields.
						I also wrote scripts to automatically verify the totals given in solicitor bills of cost in PDF format, and created a PyWebIO application to act as a 
						front end for these scripts.
					</p>
					<p>I scraped and cleaned the data for the <a class="accent-link" href="countries.html">Countries</a> page of this website using Python. The data comes from
					<a class="accent-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>



	
<br><br>
				<h2 id="skillR">R</h2><br>
				<p>I first encountered R in a Data Programming with R module that I chose to do as part of my Master's. Since then I have used R extensively as part of my 
					work in the NTMA. In this role I have used R to train machine learning models, manipulate geoJSON data to modify boundaries and create maps we did not
					otherwise have access to, extract data from the Personal Injuries Guidelines
					<a class="accent-link" href="https://judicialcouncil.ie/assets/uploads/documents/Personal%20Injuries%20Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>, and create a Shiny App 
					frontend for this data for claims managers to use.</p><p>I was instrumental in the integration of R scripts into our ETL pipeline, setting up and documenting 
					the use of Rserve to embed R scripts into Tableau Prep flows.</p>
					<p>I used R to manipulate the underlying geoJSON file for the <a class="accent-link" href="countries.html">Countries</a> page. Certain countries needed to have distant islands
					or overseas territories removed.</p>
				</p>

				<br><br>
				<h2 id="skillSQL">SQL</h2><br>
				<p>I was introduced to SQL in my HDip module Relational Databases & Information Systems, where I was taught how to use MySql. I then administered a
					MySQL database as part of a Software Engineering module's project to build an application showing Dublin Bike station availability and predicted
					future availability. I completed multiple assignments using MySQL as part of a Big Data Programming Module.
					<br>I acted as the data lead for my MSc research practicuum team and administered a PostgreSQL data base to supply data to the
					application's frontend.
				</p>
				<p>As part of my role in the NTMA I write SQL queries in Oracle SQL Developer to extract data from an Oracle server. I wrote the SQL script that is embedded
					in our ETL pipeline to detect and data quality issues.
				</p>

				<br><br>
				<h2 id="skillBash">Bash</h2><br>
					<p>I use Linux on my personal computer and am comfortable using the command line for file and system operations.
						I also have experience writing Bash scripts to automate tasks and solve problems as part a Big Data Programming module.</p>
				<br><br>

				<h2 id="skillTableau">Tableau & Power BI</h2><br>
				<p>In my data analyst role in the NTMA I use Tableau every day to create dashboards and prepare data for reports. I've created many dashboards that
					are currently in production and used by teams across the NTMA. One such dashboard contains an interactive map of active claims in Garda divisions,
					districts and stations across the country. When users select a division or district to drill down on, the map and other visuals are updated to
					show the relevant information.<br>
					I also make extensive use of Tableau Prep, creating flows to combine datasources, run data through machine learning models via embedded Python
					or R scripts, and implement processing techniques such as sentiment analysis and text similarity analysis.<br>
					Although I do not use it in my job, I have completed courses in Power BI and can use it proficiently.
				</p><br><br>

				<h2 id="skillHTMLCSSJS">HTML, CSS & JavaScript</h2><br>
				<p>I first encountered HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a Web Application Development Module. In this module I made two websites using just these
					technologies. I used these again as part of my Software Development module and Master's project, and in building this website. This site is built 
					without using any frameworks, only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
					The countries size visualiser project included in the <a class="accent-link" href="countries.html">Countries</a> page of this website was created using Javascript.
